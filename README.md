# 🤟 Crisidev Neovim Configs 🤟

Personal Neovim configuration based on LunarVim.

Take what you need, it also comes warrant free 😊

## Info

* I am usually a couple of weeks behind Neovim HEAD.
- My config is heavily based on the great work of [abzcoding](https://github.com/abzcoding/lvim)
* This config will probably not work for you out of the box, use it as an
inspiration.
